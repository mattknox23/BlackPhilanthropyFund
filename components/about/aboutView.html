            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                The Mission of the Black Philanthropy Fund (BPF) is to further enhance the tradition of African-American
                philanthropy in Boston, with a focus on increasing the magnitude and effectiveness of giving to the black
                community.  We will create a network that links black people of means, influence and skills with community
                organizations in ways that enhance our collective impact on improving conditions&#8212;especially for our children.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will select partners whose missions and integrity we believe in, and offer a range of supports
                (customized for them, and designed with them) to help them realize their potentials for positive impact.
                Our posture toward our partners will be one of respect&#8212;we will always be respectful of the knowledge
                and commitment embodied in their work; and by our actions we will strive to win their respect for our intentions
                and the quality of our support.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will work to consolidate local Black wealth and expertise, and invest them to support constructive growth
                in Boston's Black communities, and to mitigate distress and disparity.  We will do this by:
                <ul class="blueText">
                    <li>
                        Investing the financial assets, social capital and influence of the BPF in effective organizations,
                        direct community action, emerging leadership, and strategies to reduce income inequality;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leveraging our leadership status as involved, contributing African-Americans to influence the broader
                        philanthropic community toward more effective support of educational, social, economic and political
                        initiatives that show promise of positive impact;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Promoting effective approaches to measure impact, identify best practices, and offer deserved recognition
                        of all who accept the responsibility to generate positive change.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In all this work, our driving impulse is service to the people and communities with whom we most strongly identify.

            <h2>Governance and Financial Management</h2>
            <p>
                The Black Philanthropy Fund is a not-for-profit corporation organized in the
                Commonwealth of Massachusetts. It is governed by a Board of Trustees, which
                currently numbers nine (see right). Trustees are elected annually and each
                commits to active personal engagement in the activities of BPF and to an annual
                financial contribution as a condition of eligibility for re-election to the board.  The board
                is responsible for active pursuit of BPF's mission, the setting of strategic direction, fund
                raising and grant making, financial management and reporting, and active engagement
                with the community, partner institutions, and contributors.
            </p>
            <p>
                To ensure the proper and professional management, security, and governance oversight
                of contributions and other financial resources, the BPF established a Donor Advised
                Fund at The Boston Foundation which receives and independently reports upon the
                status of all contributions and disbursements from the fund. All disbursements must be
                authorized by BPF's Board of Trustees.
            </p>
            <p>
                All contributions should be made out to "The Black Philanthropy Fund (4635)" and
                mailed to the attention of The Boston Foundation, 75 Arlington St, 10th Floor, Boston,
                MA 02116.
